next steps
  make something that will compare sets of hole cards
  parser for text file describing rules/strategies
  
// general notes on the classes that are more complicated than Hand
// a player is part of a deal
// a player contains
//   a _position_
//   hole cards
//   a _range_
//   maybe a _strategy_ that contains a set of ranges based on position
//   some method for indicating the hole cards meet the range
//
//
//  position indicates how early the player must act.  It is used (right now) for selecting
//     between ranges (all contained in the strategy?)
//
//  a range is a set of _rules_
//    only hands that meet one of the rules will be included in a simulation
//
//
// a deal contains x players each with hole cards
//   and a turn and a river card
//   it is not a holder for betting
//   there must be a way to describe a deal with text file or files that
//   describe the players their positions and strategies
//  (may be the players are in distinct files)

************************************************
Make calculators for ranking hands in various situations
   how many other pair of possible hole cards beat us/tie with us/lose to us?
   show each set
